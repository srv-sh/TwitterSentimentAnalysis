# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
The aim of this project is, to explore the world of NLP(Natural Language Processing) by building what is known as a Sentiment Analysis Model.
I try to implement a system where the system would able to predict sentiment by analysing a article. There are two types of sentiment that the system able to predict. They are negative or positive. The training accuracy of this project is 79% and validation accuracy is 81%. I have used tensorflow library functions to implement this project.
